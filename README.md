## General info

This is the complement (UI interaction) to the final project of the [Ethereum Developer Bootcamp at Alchemy University](https://github.com/maoc06/Emerald-trust-hh). The project consists of an open and secure marketplace that lists and records emerald transactions in the form of NFTs üìùüì¶üîóüì¶

The motivation is not only the consolidation of the knowledge acquired in the Bootcamp, but also that I am Colombian, a country that extracts and produces the largest amount of emeralds üü¢ for the world market üåé as well as the most sought after ‚ú®, **however it does not have a decentralized, secure and fast market for retail.**
